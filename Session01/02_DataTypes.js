//Ecma International (formally European Computer Manufacturers Association) is a non-profit organization that develops standards in computer hardware, communications, and programming languages.

//As per ECMA Standard below things should be followed while writing the code.
//1) Code readablity should be High
"use strict" // 2) treat all js code as newer version of js means all the js code should follow the ecma coding standards.
// alert(3+3); // 3) If we run our code in browser it opens a pop up but here we are using node js so it will not work here.



//----Premitive Data Types --------
//1) Number => 2 to power 53
//2) bigint
//3) string => ""
//4) boolean => true/false
/* 5) null => It is a standalone value i.e let state = null; here state is empty we can give it like state = "" because here type will be 
set to string */
//6) Undefined => It is the value return when no value is decalred for any variable. i.e let state;
//7) Symbol => to find the uniqueness

//----Non Premitive Data Types --------

//Object 
console.log(typeof "Kajal") //It will return String
console.log(typeof null) //It will return Object. so type of null is always a object
console.log(typeof undefined); //It will return undefined
